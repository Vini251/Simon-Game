# Simon-Game
In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to the next level. There are different levels to this game. 

-> In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.
-> You can reset the game by clicking on wrong button.
-> I have a counter so the user knows what level they are on throughout the game.
-> I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.
